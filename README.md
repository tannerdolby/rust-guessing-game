# Guess a random number
Classic guess a random number game. Walkthrough provided by [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) of the Rust documentation book.

### Getting started
1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed.

2. Clone this repository
```
https://github.com/tannerdolby/rust-guessing-game.git
```
3. Open command line or terminal and run:
```
cargo check
```
- This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable.
4. Run and play
```
cargo run
```

### Notes
Feel free to edit the `secret_number` variable within `/src/main.rs` to increase the random number range.
